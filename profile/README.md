# Advancing Conduction-Cooled 650 MHz SRF Technology for Industrial Accelerators at Fermilab's IARC
<img src="https://bl-mirrotron.github.io/doc/mirrotronSplash.png"/><br>

The Illinois Accelerator Research Center (IARC) at Fermilab is developing a high-power, conduction-cooled Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) accelerator tailored for industrial applications requiring robust and efficient operation. A 650 MHz, 1.6 MeV, 20 kW SRF accelerator is currently under development, employing a conduction cooling approach to simplify cryogenic requirements and enhance accessibility for industrial use. The accelerator's control system is implemented on the Blinky-Lite platform, selected for its open-source architecture, secure remote access capabilities, and operational flexibilityâ€”attributes advantageous for industrial deployment and sustained operation. A dedicated beamline is designed to measure essential beam parameters and test the integrated performance of the accelerator and control systems, thereby validating their operational readiness for intended applications.
